# Library Management

The Golang + Gofr project is a robust library management system, leveraging the efficiency of Go for backend development and incorporating Gofr for streamlined web routing. The system features secure user authentication, seamless database integration using GORM, and RESTful API endpoints for managing books, users, and transactions. With a focus on concurrency, testing, and documentation, it provides a scalable and reliable solution for efficient library administration.
